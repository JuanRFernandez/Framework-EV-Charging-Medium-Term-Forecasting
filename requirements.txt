# The requirements.txt file is used in Python projects to specify a list of pip package dependencies so that they can be easily installed using pip install -r requirements.txt command. 
# It is a common practice when you're not using conda, or when you're only using pip packages.
# The environment.yml file is specific to conda, and allows you to specify both conda and pip packages. 
# It is typically used to create a conda environment using conda env create -f environment.yml.
# Since you're using conda and your environment.yml file includes both conda and pip packages, you don't need a separate requirements.txt file. 
# All your dependencies are defined in one place, which makes it easier to manage.
# The requirements.txt file can still be useful in some cases, though. 
# For example, if you have a Python project that doesn't use conda, 
# or if you want to specify pip package dependencies separately for any reason (e.g., if they are optional or only needed for development and not for running the application).
# # In summary, in your case where you have specified all your dependencies in environment.yml, you don't need requirements.txt.
